  <p align='justify'> <sup> +7 </sup> &ensp; &ensp; Full-Scale Engineering and Development was completed within the designated timeframe and thereafter for autonomous trading beginning in May 2024. The system consistently monitored the "GPS" location of crude oil in relation to its peer components. Operating on a 5-minute cycle, it employed multiple time-series regression models to assess and provide guidance on the price trajectory, risk, and reward metrics during all liquid trading hours. The system is calibrated to assess, monitor, and autonomously deploy capital optimally based on thresholds established by the firm's overseas management team. </p>

<!--
  The Firm "Requested" that I send "Signals" thereafter causing concern(s).
  - As implied by the terms in my contract are meaningful.
  
  - $2.5MM/ Annum. may have very easily been generated overseas.
  - Perhaps maybe the greater of $7MM.
  - Not worth my time to follow that path.
  - They work from many different Countries all over the World.
    -- Certain of which can not be Adjudicated or "Courted".
    -- Not for Economic Benefit here from the United States.
