# 4. &ensp; Fundamendal Guidance

</br>


  <p align='justify'> <sup> +7 </sup> &ensp; &ensp; Full-scale engineering and development were completed within the designated timeframe, with autonomous trading commencing in May 2024. The system continuously monitored the GPS location of crude oil within a network of component correlation matrices. Operating on a 5-minute cycle, it utilized multiple time-series regression models to evaluate and provide guidance on price trajectory, risk, and probability metrics. The system is calibrated to assess, monitor, and autonomously deploy capital optimally based on pre-established risk parameters determined by the firm's overseas management team. </p>

##### DISPLAY ONLY MODE.

  <p align='justify'> <sup> 2024-09-03 </sup> &ensp; &ensp; Multiple time-series regression models provide asynchronous guidance, where CL is evaluated at a value of 0.2 on a scale from 0 to 10 across the six primary regression planes. This assessment generates short- and long-term ranges and triggers additional processes to monitor the pivotal point(s) at which point in time it is optimal for entry. It further provides expected holding period (or "trade cycle"), implied volatility, and supplementary risk statistics autonomously. This system can be placed into an 'observatory', without the inclusion of the autonomous execution features and made available for any person to use. </p>
