  <p align='justify'> <sup> +7 </sup> &ensp; &ensp; Full-scale engineering and development were completed within the designated timeframe, with autonomous trading commencing in May 2024. The system continuously monitored the GPS location of crude oil within a network of component correlation matrices. Operating on a 5-minute cycle, it utilized multiple time-series regression models to evaluate and provide guidance on price trajectory, risk, and probability metrics. The system is calibrated to assess, monitor, and autonomously deploy capital optimally based on pre-established risk parameters determined by the firm's overseas management team. </p>

<!--
  The Firm "Requested" that I send "Signals" thereafter causing concern(s).
  - As implied by the terms in my contract are meaningful.
  
  - $2.5MM/ Annum. may have very easily been generated overseas.
  - Perhaps maybe the greater of $7MM.
  - Not worth my time to follow that path.
  - They work from many different Countries all over the World.
    -- Certain of which can not be Adjudicated or "Courted".
    -- Not for Economic Benefit here from the United States.
