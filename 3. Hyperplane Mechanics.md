## i. Asyncronous Regression Plane Analysis Points

*** Subsystems in Crude Oil Futures </br></br>
&ensp; MCL. &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Was thoroughly tested and succesfully placed into production. </br>
&ensp; Others. &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Have all been tested - Also are Available for production. </br>
&ensp; 10YR Future. &ensp; Has been tested - Available for production. </br>

##  ii. Redundant Navigation Subsystems

*** Subsystems in Crude Oil Futures </br></br>

&ensp; System A. &ensp; The GPS location of peer components in  Hyperplanes of N-terms 5-minute Regression Bars. </br>

## iii. Fair-Market Success Rate

1. Improved navigational accuracy and functionaly.
2. Superior coverage in a wider range of target assets.
3. Further assessments using empirical pattern recognition techniques.
4. The “Relative Guidance System” does not work.
   - Enhancement(s) as referenced in Section 1 however are thoroughly tested / available.

     
#### Alt. Decisions made early in the development process had far reaching implications using the fourth principle.  </br>

## Automatic EOD and Per Transaction Reporting 

*** Was working on this to simplify the process of Autonomous EOD REPORTING
* Calls and also sends SMS with Transaction details.
* Position and Exposure Details Using Real-Time Datafeeds.
* Program parses and outputs data using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to TXT/ etc.
