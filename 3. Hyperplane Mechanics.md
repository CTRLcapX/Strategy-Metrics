## i. &ensp; Asyncronous Regression Plane Analysis Points

*** Subsystems in Crude Oil Futures </br></br>
&ensp; MCL. &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Was thoroughly tested and succesfully placed into production. </br>
&ensp; Others. &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Have all been tested - Also are Available for production. </br>
&ensp; 10YR Future. &ensp; Has been tested - Available for production. </br>

##  ii. &ensp; Redundant Navigation Subsystems

*** Subsystems in Crude Oil Futures </br></br>

&ensp; System A. &ensp; The GPS location of peer components in  Hyperplanes of N-terms 5-minute Regression Bars. </br>
&ensp; System B. &ensp; Monitor changes in Correlations with respect to System A. </br>

## iii. &ensp; Fair-Market Success Rate

1. Improved navigational accuracy and functionality.
2. Superior coverage of a wider range of target assets under observation.
3. Further assessments using empirical pattern recognition techniques as referenced in Section 1.
4. The “Relative Guidance System” is not a predictable system.
   - Enhancement(s) as referenced in Section 1 however are thoroughly tested / available.

## Automatic EOD and Per Transaction Reporting 

*** Was working on this to simplify the process of Autonomous EOD REPORTING
* Calls and also sends SMS with Transaction details.
* Position and Exposure Details Using Real-Time Datafeeds.
* Program parses and outputs data using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to TXT/ etc.
