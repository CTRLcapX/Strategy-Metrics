## iii. &ensp; Fair-Market Success Rate

1. Improved navigational accuracy and functionality.
2. Superior coverage of a wider range of target assets under observation.
3. Further assessments using empirical pattern recognition techniques as referenced in Section 1.
4. The “Relative Guidance System” is not a predictable system.
   - Enhancement(s) as referenced in Section 1 however are thoroughly tested / available.

## Automatic EOD and Per Transaction Reporting 

*** Was working on this to simplify the process of Autonomous EOD REPORTING </br>

* Calls and also sends SMS with Transaction details.
* Position and Exposure Details Using Real-Time Datafeeds.
* Program parses and outputs any information using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to TXT/ EMAIL/ WhatsApp / ETC.
* Example: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/228494f8-1e2f-401f-a654-a0f6fea44bd0
